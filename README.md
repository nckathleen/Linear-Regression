# Signs of Regression

## Description

Practice using linear regression through exercises.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Use scikit-learn to perform linear regression
* Understand single-variable and multiple-variable linear regression

## Tasks
```markdown
* [ ] Blank slate
  * [ ] Create a GitHub repo called `linear-regression`
  * [ ] Copy all the files from this repo into it
  * [ ] Set up your requirements/virtual environment
* [ ] Normal mode
  * [ ] Complete the tasks in the `simple-linear-regression.ipynb` file
    * [ ] Ground cricket chirps
    * [ ] Brain vs. Body Weight
    * [ ] Salary Discrimination
  * [ ] Make sure your findings are well-organized, using Markdown headers and formatting to separate sections
  * [ ] Ensure your notebook runs when all the outputs are cleared and the cells are run in order (restart your kernel, clear all outputs, and run all cells)
* [ ] Hard mode
  * [ ] Find another source of data that you suspect may have a single- or multiple-linear relationship
  * [ ] Attempt to find a best fit model for the data
  * [ ] Report your findings, showing chart(s) as necessary

```


## Details

### Deliverables

* A Git repo called linear-regression containing at least:
  * a `requirements.txt` file
  * `simple-linear-regression.ipynb`
  * supporting data files

## Normal Mode

Go through the `simple-linear-regression.ipynb` file included with this repository and add cells to address the prompts, exploring the data through the use of pandas and scikit-learn.

Your final submission should be a well-organized IPython notebook file with charts and data exploring linear relationships in the data.

## Hard Mode

Find another source of data that you suspect may have a single- or multiple-linear relationship, attempt to find a best fit model for the data, and report your findings, showing chart(s) as necessary
